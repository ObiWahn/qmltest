# QT CMake Examples

Because of the lack of working examples with modern CMake and QT6 I'll try to provide some
working examples here. If you think that the style is bad or have suggestions to improve
the samples please let me know

## Samples

qml resources in:

 - `qml_in_executable` this seems to be the default case that can be found everywhere
 - `qml_in_static_backing_lib-no_plugin` with this you can pull the UI related stuff out of your main CMakeLists.txt

## Documentation and other Repositories

 - https://gitlab.com/kelteseth/qt6-cmake-qml-plugin-example-project (an excellent example project)

## Critique

 - https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmlfirststeps.html (How much better was this if they would show how to build the example?!)
